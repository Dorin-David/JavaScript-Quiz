This is a JavaScript quiz with intermediate/advanced questions. The questions are taken from a well know [repo](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions) on Github. This project is a WORK IN PROGRESS. Right now the questions are stored on the client side; soon 
they may be moved to a database. To run this project, clone on your local machine. You need a live server to run it (the app will be moved to a rel server when enough questions will be added); we suggest you install the *Live Server* on VSC code, which will allow modules to work.
